Thelema is a general-purpose programming language of the Lisp family, and is 
closest to R6RS Scheme in overall structure. However, Thelema takes a more pragmatic
tack on several design questions, and is intended to to allow flexible reflectivity
and a more general (if less hygienic) macro system.


General Syntax
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Thelema program consists of one or more lists of the form

<program> ::= [<list> | <symbol>]+

<list> ::= "(" <data-component>* ")"

<data-component> ::= <atom>
			       | <list>
				   | "'" <data-component>

<atom> ::= <symbol>

         | <char-constant>
         | <string-constant>
		 | <boolean-constant>
		 
<symbol> ::= <symbol-start-character> [<letter> | <digit> | <non-reserved-character>]*

<symbol-start-character> ::= [<letter> | <non-reserved-glyph>]

<non-reserved-glyph> ::= "!" | "$" | "*" | "&" | "-" | "_" | "+" | "=" | "?" | "/" | "{" |  "}" | "[" | "]"
		 
<reserved-glyph> ::= "'" | '"' | "`" | "@" | "#" | ";" | ":" | "^" | "." | "~" 

<keyword> ::= ":" <symbol>

<method-invocation> ::= "^" <symbol>

<class-method-invocation> ::= "~" <symbol>

<non-reserved-character> ::= <letter> | <digit> | <non-reserved-glyph>
		 
<char-constant> ::= "#\" [<non-reserved-character> | <special-character-name>]

<special-character-name> := "newline" | "tab" | "space" 
                          | "quote" | "double-quote" | "quasi-quote" | "at" 
						  | "percent" | "colon" | "hash" |"caret" | "period"
						  | "semi-colon" 

<sign> ::= "-" | "+"

<exactitude> ::= "i" | "e"
						  
<numeric-constant> ::= <integer-constant>
					 | <real-constant>
					 | <rational-constant>
					 | <complex-constant>
					 
<integer-constant> ::= {<sign>} <decimal-constant>
                     | "#x" <hex-digit>+
					 | "#o" <octal-digit>+
					 | "#b" <binary-digit>+

<binary-digit> ::= "0" | "1"					 
	
<decimal-constant> ::= <digit>+

<flonum-constant> ::= <decimal-constant> "." <decimal-constant>

<real-constant> ::=  {<sign>} {<exactitude>} <flonum-constant>
                   					 
<rational-constant> ::= <decimal-constant> "/" <decimal-constant>

<complex-constant> ::= {<sign>} <flonum-constant> <sign> <flonum-constant> "j"

<string-constant> ::= '"' <character>* '"'

<boolean-constant> ::= "#" ["t" | "f"]

Thelema is a general-purpose programming language of the Lisp family, and is closest to R6RS Scheme in overall structure.
However, Thelema takes a more pragmatic tack on several design questions, and is intended to to allow flexible reflectivity
and a more general (if less hygenic) macro system.


Standard Binding Forms
>>>>>>> 0879b6901cf3b07bc6ca3d0dca7a813ef19885f7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: primitive or system forms are pre-pended with a dollar sign '$'. This is a convention meant to 

(eval x env)
Evaluate the list x in the given environment.

(apply func args)
Apply a function to a set of arguments.

($bind env x y) 
Bind a symbol to a value in the given environment. Primitive form used to build the various 'def' hooks.

(def x binding)
General-purpose binding macro. Can be extended by the client-programmer using 'def-hook' meta-macro.

- (const value)
Adds a constant to static memory, and returns a reference to it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- (enum (key-list))
Defines an enumeration type, consisting of a list of keys and optional values. The 'def' name binding causes the key names to be bound to a generated symbol of the form "type-name%key". Keyword modifiers include ':class', for setting the class of values, and ':value', for setting the value of a given key. 
=======
- (enum ((key :value)))
Defines an enumeration type, consisting of a list of keys and optional values. The 'def' name binding cuases the key names to be bound to a generated symbol of the form "type-name^key".
>>>>>>> 0879b6901cf3b07bc6ca3d0dca7a813ef19885f7

- (fn (args) body)
Basic function constructor. Returns an anonymous function. Functions created with fn *must not* have any side effects, nor call on any procedures. Keywords include ':domain', which restricts an argument to a given domain; 'domain-assert?', which applies one or more predicates to the argument's value; ':co-domain', which promises a given return value type; and ':co-domain-assert?', which applies predicates to the return value.

- (proc (args) body) 
Basic procedure constructor. Returns an anonymous procedure. Procedures may have side-effects. In addition to the keywords applicable to a function, a procedure may have ':input', indicating that it reads a value from a source other than an argument; ':output', which indicates that it outputs to a destination other than the result; :access and :alter, which allows it to read or alter a value in the lexical environment, respectively; and :access-dynamic and :alter-dynamic, which does the same for a value in the dynamic environment. These keywords are always optional, but are used by the compiler to optimize the generated code.

- (pred (args) body)
Specialized form of fn that is used to create predicates; must return a boolean value.

- (class (parents) slots)
Define a new type or class of variables. 
These three forms re specific to within a class definition:
-- (property keyword-value-pairs)
-- (method (args) body)
-- (ctor (args) body) 

- (macro (args) body)
Creates a simple named macro.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(import (module) :min-version :max-version :imported-components) 
Import a module. the module argument is a list of module-submodule-etc. names. :min-version is a required
keyword argument specifying the minimum version of the module as a four-part list, three numeric values and an enumeration containing either 'alpha', 'beta', 'release-candidate', or 'stable', with priority in that order (lowest to highest). :max-version is an optional keyword argument in the same format as :min-version. Imported-components is an optional list of imported functions, macros, classes, constants, etc. If imported-components is not specified, the entire library is imported, with name-munging.

In Thelema, name-munging consists of automatically generating a name for the imported components in the form 

    module-name%sub-module-name%sub-sub-module-name%...%component

for example, 
    (import (controls conditionals) :min-version (0 0 1 alpha))

    (controls%conditionals%unless (pred? x) (func y))	
	
Since this is a generated symbol acting as the name of the imported component, there is no need for any special syntax.
