Before I can set the game up, there are a few basic questions I will need to answer, and I wanted to give everyone a chance to speak their mind on the subject.

The first question is which game system to use. There are several choices, with the major ones being

    HERO System (aka Champions)
    GURPS
    Fate
    Mutants & Masterminds
    ICONS
    Villains & Vigilantes
    HeroQuest
    Big Eyes, Small Mouth

 I suppose that we could even use Teenagers From Outer Space if we want a particularly silly, over-the-top slapstick campaign, too, but that would probably be a bit difficult given the setting. Of these, I personally am most comfortable with HERO, but I am also leaning towards Fate given what I've been told about it. I have some Barnes and Noble gift cards on hand, so I plan to order at least on game manual as soon as I have some idea which. Any comments?


Next is the year to set it in. It would probably be best to avoid the periods from 2006-2010 and  2016-2020, as that would overlap with the canon storylines, and in particular would mean some game-breakingly powerful characters would be on campus (e.g., Tennyo, Fey, Carmilla, Nimbus, the New Olympians - if you don't know these people yet, just trust me when I say that they would be a problem for me as the GM) as well as leading to an almost certain divergence from canon right from the start (it will diverge, but something too close to the series would make it likely that story and game would get confused). It would also give us the whole period from 1966 to 2002 (or so) to set the game in, so have plenty of choices for period setting. I personally like either 1968, 1985, or 1995. Anyone else got any suggestions?


I need some time to post additional points about this, as well as start working fleshing out on the character guidelines and writing up summaries of the basic source material.
